The files inside "notepad" are all of the files I worked on around 8th grade when beginning to code in Java. Although they may not be very interesting or impressive files, I think the sheer volume alone displays my passion and resilience for programming. I still treasure these files as they remind me of the journey I've been through and continue to pursue.

The "eclipse" files are all of the files I created when transitioning to eclipse. Here I was mainly experimenting with GUI in Java, and I still find some of those projects quite interesting. There are many more that I made, but I'd like to keep some to myself.

Unfortunately, I cannot provide the projects/exercises made during my ITP course due to copyright restrictions.
